# [Tasks](https://app.gsmtasks.com/tasks)

## The default filter

Tasks list can be filtered with either default filter or custom filter.

You can filter by various fields, including the custom ones. The filter resets to the default filter once you leave
the view, unless it's saved as the default filter.

To select multiple values
1. first select a single value,
2. then click the filter to edit it and add more values.

Saving the current view as the default stores the filter in the browser. That means:
  - users can't share the filters
  - it's possible to have multiple filters using a different browser, [browser profiles](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-remove-switch-firefox-profiles)
    or [Firefox containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/)
